EXE release is in the releases tab if you want a plain exe file. I could use pyinstaller to make a .app file, but I'm booted into windows right now, and I will probably forget about it.

Inspired by the peppa pig episode "Daddy Pig's Work".
Look at the repo description for more context, and for further context, search "Season 2, Episode 22 Peppa Pig"
